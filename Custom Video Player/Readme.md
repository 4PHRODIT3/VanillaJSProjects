#Video Player with custom controls
#In HTML 5, you can use "controls" attribute for control functions but default is so convenient in some scenarios. Default UI for controls are so ordinary.

#In this mini Project, I inspire control UI from YouTube
#Lets take step by steps

#1. Create UI First and add some JavaScript for mouseenter or mouseleave effects
#2. Get all HTML element with DOM
#3. Construct functions for normal functions ,i.e. play, pause and Stop Functions
#4. Make something with DOM to change timestamp (only for display timestamp)
#5. Functions to set the current video time according to the change of range
