### Video Player with custom controls

- In HTML 5, you can use "controls" attribute for control functions but default is so convenient in some scenarios. Default UI for controls are so ordinary.

- In this mini Project, I inspire control UI from YouTube

- Lets take step by steps

- Create UI First and add some JavaScript for mouseenter or mouseleave effects

- Get all HTML element with DOM

- Construct functions for normal functions ,i.e. play, pause and Stop Functions

- Make something with DOM to change timestamp (only for display timestamp)

- Functions to set the current video time according to the change of range
