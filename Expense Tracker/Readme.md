### Expense Tracker

- Simple Expense Tracker that can store your income and expense. Moreover It will calculate your remaining balance.

- Firstly Create UI. I used neumorphic soft-design and make responsive for all media devices.

- Then code with JS to store your transitions in localStorage.

- Next, code for remove transition history features (If you want, you can add also edit history).

- Add more event handling animation for user-experience.

- Enjoy!
