### Hangman

- Just a Simple game to guess the meaning

- Firstly, create UI and make responsive (Actually I copied SVG from this project owner :3)

- We have an array to store the random meaning for the game

- In the game, show the numbers of character that the random meaning has.

- Using keyboard event to determine the typed one included in the random word

- Show the typed one when it is the same as before or it is wrong

- If wrong words exceeds the number of character, terminated it.
